Vanilla Pumpkin Spice,Fae,4.0,"Not bad, could be better","I've come to really love this brand, but of course there's always gonna be a flaw. I think they missed the mark just a little with this one.

I may try to brew it on the Strong setting and see if that makes a difference, but I think they have better flavors.

Chocolate Raspberry Truffle,AshGray,5.0,Delicious and eco-friendly as well!,"I received a sampler of these months ago for my birthday from my housemate. I loved them! I just found them on Amazon and decided to 'experiment' with flavors. I ordered the chocolate variety pack and the chocolate raspberry truffle pack (my favorite and was my gift previously mentioned!) They are amazing! The description on the lid of each pod label is 100% correct; whatever it says that is the flavor, by golly it is -- some other brands' flavors listed is nowhere near the a actual flavor. I like the fact that the pods themselves are biodegradable and compost friendly which is very eco-friendly. I use them in my Keurig and my housemate opens them up and makes the coffee in his French press. The flavor isn't bitter or artificial tasting like other I have tried, they have a nice smooth flavor and you really don't need to add any creamer or sugar to enhance the flavor. I like the chocolate raspberry truffle with a little squirt of Redi-Whip cream on top and some chocolate sprinkles or powder as well. I served this to company and they thought I brewed this in a cappuccino machine. I showed them the pods and now they will order some as well.

Chocolate Peanut Buttercup,JESSICA,4.0,Absolutely Delicious!!,"Love this coffee! I add cream and sugar but that's my preference. I never was one for flavored coffees. Growing up my parents had the Gevalia flavored coffee, never liked it. This stuff is absolutely wonderful. I only drink one big cup a day and Crazy Cups makes me so excited to turn my coffee maker on. I will say this coffee is easy to burn... So I have to brew my k-cup as soon as my coffee maker is warmed up. Unfortunately I can't change my brew temps. This peanut butter cup flavor is one of my favorites!!!! The smell when it's brewing...

Chocolate Raspberry Truffle,Holly A Lee,1.0,Horrifying! Blech!,"I'd be ""crazy"" to say the flavor is anything but flavorful. I tried it iced last week and thought perhaps I had added too much cream so the next day I tried it with less. Still terrible! The only salvation for this flavor was to ""doctor"" it by adding raspberry extract and a K-Cup of hot cocoa. And tonight some black raspberry ice cream to make a frappe. Sadly, there was still an odd aftertaste. Van Houtte has a far superior flavor and nothing to worry about this as competition. Unfortunately I ordered 80 pods of this swill so I ordered six bottles of extract to get me thru it.

Crazy Cups Flavored Variety Pack Decaf,Fadi Shamaan,5.0,A 40-Flavor Journey!,"Let me tell you about my experience with the Coffee Pods Variety Pack Sampler, Assorted Single Serve Coffee for Keurig K Cups Coffee Makers, 2 Each of 40 Unique Coffees, Great Coffee Gifts, 80 Count. I ordered this pack on a whim, looking for something to spice up my morning routine. Little did I know, this pack would become my new obsession.

First off, the variety is unparalleled. With 40 unique coffees, there's something for everyone. From bold and strong to sweet and creamy, this pack has it all. And with two pods of each flavor, I could share with my friends and family (though I'll admit, I was tempted to keep them all for myself).

But let's talk about the taste. Oh. My. Goodness. I felt like a kid in a candy store, trying a new flavor every day. The Blueberry Cobbler had me singing ""a-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom"" like Little Richard. The French Vanilla made me want to break out my beret and start speaking with a terrible French accent. And the Caramel Macchiato? Let's just say, I'm pretty sure I saw the face of God.

But the best part? The packaging. The pods come in a beautifully designed box that looks like it belongs on the shelves of a boutique coffee shop. It made me feel fancy just looking at it. And when I opened it up, I was like a kid on Christmas morning, tearing through the packaging to get to the goodies inside.

Overall, I would give this Coffee Pods Variety Pack Sampler a 5 out of 5 stars. It's the perfect gift for any coffee lover, or just a treat for yourself. Plus, it's a great way to discover new flavors without committing to a full bag of coffee. So go ahead, treat yourself. You won't regret it. And who knows, maybe you'll find your new favorite brew (just be prepared to sing its praises like I am).

Here are some dos and don’ts:

Dos:
1. Do choose a variety pack that includes different coffee flavors and roasts so that you can try different types of coffee.
2. Do read the product description carefully to ensure that the coffee pods are compatible with your coffee maker.
3. Do consider the number of coffee pods in the pack and the price per pod to ensure that you are getting good value for money.
4. Do read reviews from other customers to get an idea of the quality of the coffee and the variety pack.
5. Do store the coffee pods in a cool, dry place to ensure that they stay fresh and flavorful.
Don'ts:
1. Don't choose a variety pack without checking the compatibility with your coffee maker, as this may result in wastage.
2. Don't overlook the price per pod, as some variety packs may seem like a good deal, but end up being more expensive per pod than buying individual packs.
3. Don't buy a variety pack without researching the different types of coffee included in the pack, as you may end up with flavors that you don't enjoy.

Chocolate Lovers Variety Pack,jennifer trested,4.0,"great tasting coffee, but MUST make sure that the machine pierces the bottom of the cup","This coffee tastes amazing, and brews well.

The one problem, which many other people have mentioned, is that the needle on your machine that needs to pierce the k cup, is not always able to pierce the bottom of these cups. It does cause the coffee to explode all over the place and makes a mess.

There is an easy fix though. My machine has a removable case that the k cup sits in. With other k cups when you put the pod into the case in the machine, the needle will pierce the cup. I don't trust that it will with these cups, so instead I push the cup hard into the case that has the needle, and make sure that it pierces the hole in the bottom before I put it into the machine. Most of the time this works, and you will be able to tell because you can hear the sound when it pierces the cup. If that does not work I cut a hole in the bottom of the cup with a knife. Not a perfect fix but thought I would put it out there that you can make these cups work in the machine.

That said, Crazy Cups really needs to look at their manufacturing process and make the plastic a little thinner.

Also, I tried their method for making the iced coffee and it still tasted watery. I brew my coffee the night before, put it in a travel mug, and let it cool in the refrigerator. I also make some coffee ice cubes out of the same batch of coffee, and put those in the coffee the next day.

Salted Caramel,Drindi,5.0,Flavors I Never Knew I Wanted in Coffee,"I can't handle the caffeine anymore, but I LOVE the smell & taste of coffee. So, I looked for decaf & found Crazy Cups with such a good value for so many kcups and various flavors to try. They smell amazing. My husband and I enjoy playing ""guess that flavor"" when I brew a cup. He smells it and likes to guess what flavor it is. So far, the only 2 I've not enjoyed, personally, are the peanutbutter chocolate and (surprisingly) the French vanilla. The peanutbutter smells and tastes like dirt/soil (oddly, my husband and I both thought so without even mentioning it to one another), and the vanilla left an odd aftertaste on my tongue that wouldn't go away. The rest are delightful though and I will be buying them again in the future. My favorites are Death by Chocolate, Coconut Chocolate, and Iced Oatmeal Cookie.

Death By Chocolate : Really deep chocolate flavor and really good.
Chocolate Coconut Dream: Good chocolate flavor with coconut if you like coconut .. found it ok
Chocolate Raspberry Truffle: Gave this one away as I don't like Raspberries. Did try a sip and the person I gave it to loved it.
Chocolate Chipolte Mole: Threw this one away as I hate anything spicy. Can't even imagine this one.
Peppermint Chocolate Mocha: Again a nice brew if you like Peppermint.

Chocolate Lovers Variety Pack,Corby,3.0,Needs More Chocolate Flavor!,"These are okay, they contain lot of different chocolate variety flavors. This works fine in my first generation Keurig causing no problem while brewing. They seem really exciting and fun with great flavor combos and smell so good.

You would think that they claim this as an assorted chocolate lovers coffee, it should be really chocolaty, borderline rich and sweet flavored, yet it leaves something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, these are good, but certainty do not live up to my expectations I had of them. The peppermint is the only one that has a distinct different flavor, yet that is the minty part and not really a strong chocolate back flavor. I really wanted the death by chocolate and the raspberry truffle to be extra good, but they are no better or distinctive from the other flavors.

I am lowering this to two stars because the second time I ordered this I had an inordinate amount of pods I don't like very much including a duplicate of hot chocolate. The order I had prior were many nice flavored coffees and cappuccinos and top notch tea with some interesting hot chocolate. It did have one of those typical mass produced store brands. This one was very disappointing and I'm cancelling my subscription.

I was very happy with this box I received from subscribe & save, I saw I had it for every 3 months and thought, ""No! Every month at least! This is great!""
Then I saw the price on the next delivery and went with. ""3 months it is!""

Overall it's a very strong blend with one I term as NO (Folgers, we all know what Folgers is. Don't put it into a variety pack).

I loved a lot of the flavored coffees which were much like dessert, but what occurred to me while I was drinking a deluge happened to be...How many calories have I consumed of this wonderful sugary artificial goodness?

I decided some things are best left not knowing.

The blend is primarily coffee, but there is also some tea and hot chocolate blended in.

I'm familiar with many of the blends but this is my first time having ""Crazy Cups"" and I absolutely love the taste of these without adding any milk or something else.

Chocolate Lovers Variety Pack,Music Wife,2.0,CRAZY CUPS PAY ATTENTION: Be careful if you value your coffee maker but flavor is spot on ; (,"Okay lets start with the pros for encouragement....the flavors of each of these chocolate lovers coffees are spot on (peanut butter and the coconut one are my favorites) all with out any bitter bite and are very smooth.

now the cons: They are not compatible with all Keurig coffee makers, for I have read some people have no problems, but many others have repeated blow outs...I tried one in the pod it came in and it shut down my machine so having read other peoples problem I removed the top and filled my reusable pod with the coffee and it did the samething so I removed some of the coffee and it worked just fine, but still blew out my paper filter I use for easier clean up, Next time I used even less of the coffee in my reusable set up and it worked even better. Now when I removed the top from the first pod I found it had blown out the filter in the pod and that is the reason most people get grounds in their coffee even when it works with their coffee maker. I had to remove all the coffee and put it in individual baggies and use my reusable pods. Part of buying the pods is the convenience of use and these do not provide that, then there is the possible damage it can do to your coffee maker.

So if you do not mind the inconvenience of pouring out the coffee into baggies and then scooping the coffee out into reusable pods it is okay, but it has to be cheaper and a time saver to buy this coffee in bags (if only they came in bags) in place of the pods if you are going to do this.

Salted Caramel,Kristine A.,2.0,Great variety of flavors but pods explode!,"Updated 11/19/19- Well, after the 3rd pod exploding and shooting coffee grounds all over the place, I'm afraid I won't be reordering these. As much as I LOVE the coffee, I can't risk ruining my keurig machine, not to mention the mess and the waste. Sucks! ORIGINAL REVIEW: I really love the variety of flavors. It's so hard to find decaf in flavors other than French vanilla and hazelnut. I was a little skeptical about apple pie a la mode and bananas foster, but with a little Italian sweet creme creamer they were great and would go great with a muffin or other pastry. It's fun experimenting with ""pairing"" them with different creamers, like a fine wine!

Chocolate Lovers Variety Pack,Geoffrey,1.0,These K-Cups spill coffee into my Cuisinart Keurig system!,"My household is coffee drinkers. The Mrs and I drink a pot of coffee every a.m., so we know coffee. The whole point for a K-Cup system is for that one-off cup, or when you don’t feel like drinking a pot! We’re a LavAzza household, ever day… so it’s important to us.

The boys love the hot chocolate… and I was notified that Amazon was out of the Solimo… so they suggested Crazy Cups... Here’s how I arrived in this brand… that we don’t know.. It was a suggestion from Amazon (first mistake).

I purchased the sampler pack, which had five different flavors. Price seemed decent, sure, why not, seems to have an overabundance of positive reviews (I needed to have dug deeper before I pulled this trigger!), so I bought a pack.

Box arrived, excellent packaging... no assembly of rhyme or reason in the box to how the flavors were just thrown in (first lousy omen), and I noticed what felt and seemed like they overstuffed each K-Cup (second horrible omen). So we separated the piles of flavors, and I took one for a test spin.

On the seal, “Freshly Roasted Coffee” – I’ve always found, when they say “good, eat, tasty, etc.” in the title, usually it’s the opposite and chaos ensues, sadly this was not any different. What poured out, smelled terrific, a little too good to be true! At first sip, black coffee, nothing in it, just to taste the base. To my shock and dismay, I was underwhelmed... UNDERWHELEMD PEOPLE!

I’ve had better coffee at Denny’s on a road trip when you need that cuppa, just to keep your eyes peeled on the road.. they have a far better-tasting coffee then this! Secondly, the flavor... “Death by chocolate,” I think not! Frankly, for all the Betty Ford recovering chocaholics, this is insulting to call this chocolate… little foil coins have far better-tasting chocolate then this!

Tried the 2nd K-Cup and BOOM coffee grounds everywhere. Remember the overstuffing comment earlier… well, this is my theory, or it’s just NOT compatible with the system we own... gee that would have been nice to know to go in! Crazy Cups has this weird indentation on the bottom like the K-Cup sat on a basketball.. left an odd dimple… what’s the point?

The other K-Cups that we enjoy, such as Cafe Bustelo, Swiss Miss, LavAzza, and even Amazon’s own Solimo, works fine. Crazy Cups, your K-Cups make the grounds go everywhere except where they belong! Now I am stuck with K-Cups that will probably break then give coffee. This isn’t the first one to do this! I’ll never repurchase your brand!
If you drink coffee, like we drink coffee, this is not your coffee! Crazy Cups K-Cup coffee is a sad joke pretending to be coffee!

Crazy Cups Flavored Variety Pack Decaf,Poodle Mom Groomer,1.0,"One pod was open/used, very thin and no taste","Received item and box looked unsealed, but figured maybe it was damaged in shipping. Opened box and started putting away and noticed bottom of box had a lot of grounds in it. Then found a pod that appeared opened and used.
These do not have much flavor and brew very thin, all you taste is water really even on a small cup or expresso size setting. Just really no flavor or thickness. They have a lot left in them after brewing unlike most other pods so it’s almost like they don’t really brew.
I liked the amount of flavor options offered in the box initially, but you do not taste any of the flavors.

Crazy Cups Flavored Variety Pack Decaf,A. Ryan,4.0,Some really good flavors in this pack,"I love flavored coffees and I love trying out new flavors. This pack gives you tons of flavors to try, and you are sure to find at least one that you will love! I have seen some reviews here that state that their pods sometimes did not work, or left coffee grounds everywhere or whatever. I will say honestly that I did not have that problem with any of the pods in my pack. There were a few pods that for whatever reason seemed to have ""bubbled."" The top of the pod and/or the sides were bubbled. But the coffee in them seemed fine. I am using a Keurig Mini Plus, and all of my pods worked with this machine with no problem.

Here is a breakdown of my impressions of each flavor that I received in this pack:

White Chocolate Strawberry: Smells like Strawberry Quick or Captain Crunch with Crunchberries while brewing. Definitely taste the strawberry, but it’s got a bitter aftertaste.

Chocolate Glazed Donut: This one is pretty tasty. It does taste a bit like a chocolate donut tastes, and no bitter aftertaste, so I am happy with it.

Cinnamon French Toast: I have tried the Double Donut Coffee flavored k-cups, and they also have a Cinnamon French Toast flavor. My thoughts on that one were that it tastes like burnt coffee with cinnamon. Which kind of makes sense, I guess. I just wasn’t a fan. BUT...the Crazy Cups version of Cinnamon French Toast? A completely different experience. As soon as it started brewing, there was a cinnamon/maple aroma that was very reminiscent of french toast. The flavor was the same: cinnamon with a hint of maple. I did get some sort of toasty flavor, but not burnt toast like the Double Donut Coffee version. No bitter aftertaste. This one was subtle, but lovely.

Toasted Oatmeal Cookie: My thought was that this would probably be similar to the Cinnamon French Toast flavor, but no. When it was brewing it actually did smell kind of like Oatmeal Cookies baking, which is bizarre but good. I was trying to think of what was in an oatmeal cookie that they could have replicated here...butter and brown sugar maybe? The taste was slightly like carmel, but not exactly. Again, a really lovely flavor.

Butter Pecan Swirl: definitely has a buttery, nutty aroma while brewing. The flavor is more nutty than buttery.

Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup: I can’t decide if I like this one, honestly. It had a vaguely peanut butter smell when brewing, and did in a way taste like a peanut butter cup. But it also had this weird “dirt” flavor to it. I guess some would argue that peanuts have a weird dirty flavor, and they wouldn’t be wrong, so, maybe this is spot on in terms of flavor? I just don’t know if I would drink it all the time.

Chocolate Raspberry Truffle: I definitely smell the raspberry when this is brewing. Nice raspberry flavor with a hint of chocolate. A tiny bit bitter at the finish like the White Chocolate Strawberry was. Maybe this is due to the berry flavoring?

Death by Chocolate: Okay...this does have a more chocolatey flavor than any of the others. Kind of reminds me of the dark chocolate suckers you can get from Sees Candy.

Salted Caramel: One of my favorites, at least in the brewing process, because I love salted caramel, and this smells amazing while brewing! Taste is also really good! The finish is very caramelly.

Bananas Foster Flambe: Yep, this smells and tastes like bananas and caramel. There are other banana flavored things that I have tried that taste a little to fake, but this flavor of coffee, for me, did not tip too far into the “fake banana” realm.

Vanilla Pumpkin Spice: Very nice “pumpkin spice” aroma as it’s brewing, but not too strong. But, not really a fan of this one in general. Not a whole lot of “pumpkin spice” flavor while you’re drinking it, though the finish is nice.

Peppermint Chocolate Mocha: This one was okay, but really could have had a bit more peppermint in it. I do understand that it’s easy to go overboard with the peppermint, but a tiny bit more would have helped here.

Better than Hazelnut: Loved this one! VERY hazel-nutty, if that’s a word, and I love hazelnut. I have had some hazelnut coffees that are more chocolate, or taste more like Nutella, but this one is more hazelnut than anything else, and I am fine with that.

Cinnamon Churro: This one was a bit underwhelming. Could have used a lot more cinnamon flavor. I’ve tried this twice now, and both times I’ve been disappointed by the lack of flavor.

Chocolate Coconut Dream: When this is brewing, there is a definite aroma of a Mounds Bar, or some other chocolate coconut candy. There is a nice chocolate/coconut taste to this one, very much like an Almond Joy or Mounds.

Caramel Pumpkin Spice: Same as the Vanilla Pumpkin Spice above. A nice aroma of Pumpkin Spice while brewing, but this one had that layer of Caramel that smelled really delicious. Tastes amazing as well! This is one of my favorite flavors so far. A good one for the fall season!

French Vanilla Twist: This smelled a lot like a glazed donut while brewing. The taste has a very mild but pleasant vanilla flavor, with some toasty notes.

Caramel Vanilla: Kind of like this one didn’t really know what it wanted to be, caramel or vanilla. There wasn’t enough of either flavor to give it any kind of distinction. For caramel, I prefer the “Salted Caramel” flavor, and for vanilla, I prefer the “French Vanilla Twist.”

Chocolate Meltaway: Really nice chocolate aroma while brewing, and a good strong chocolate flavor. This may be another of my favorites."," October 13, 2020",the United States 🇺🇸,"i love flavored coffees and i love trying out new flavors. this pack gives you tons of flavors to try, and you are sure to find at least one that you will love! i have seen some reviews here that state that their pods sometimes did not work, or left coffee grounds everywhere or whatever. i will say honestly that i did not have that problem with any of the pods in my pack. there were a few pods that for whatever reason seemed to have ""bubbled."" the top of the pod and/or the sides were bubbled. but the coffee in them seemed fine. i am using a keurig mini plus, and all of my pods worked with this machine with no problem. here is a breakdown of my impressions of each flavor that i received in this pack: white chocolate strawberry: smells like strawberry quick or captain crunch with crunchberries while brewing. definitely taste the strawberry, but it’s got a bitter aftertaste. chocolate glazed donut: this one is pretty tasty. it does taste a bit like a chocolate donut tastes, and no bitter aftertaste, so i am happy with it. cinnamon french toast: i have tried the double donut coffee flavored k-cups, and they also have a cinnamon french toast flavor. my thoughts on that one were that it tastes like burnt coffee with cinnamon. which kind of makes sense, i guess. i just wasn’t a fan. but...the crazy cups version of cinnamon french toast?

Crazy Cups Flavored Variety Pack Decaf,snowingstars,3.0,Don't be surprised if your box is not as described!,"I love these flavors so far. I was disappointed that some flavors were substituted with Christmas or seasonal flavors so I didn't get exactly what was listed or in the quantities described. That was my purpose in getting such a big box to sample was for the biggest variety of flavors to try out. So that's a definite downside considering it was so detailed in the description as to what I would get in my box. I kinda feel if it was so precise that I should've gotten exactly what was listed. But what I have tried so far is really good. They have much more coffee and flavor to them and are really good for someone who really enjoys flavored coffee.

Chocolate Lovers Variety Pack,Fred,1.0,NOT for diabetics!,"Updated review: Now that my wife went through nearly the whole box (since she had to throw away brew after brew because they were sweetened coffee/tea/hot chocolate), I'm changing my review to 1 star.
This product is good if you want your k-pod packed with sugar. If you want coffee or tea and a choice whether or not you want it sweet, then stay away from this product. As to me, when you consider how many you throw away (more than 50%), it is not even a good bargain per K-pod.

Original review: When I order coffee, I don't expect sugar in my K-Pod, unless specifically ordering a caramel french vanilla or some other variation of a sweet coffee. My wife, a diabetic, has tried about 10. At least 3 of the 10 she tried were sweetened. There is no writing on the K-Pods for the most part except for the name.

Crazy Cups Flavored Variety Pack Decaf,Estelle,1.0,Faulty K-Cups,"My sister and I love our flavored coffees, and have a few cups a day. We received this shipment on April 13 and started using Crazy Cups flavored k-cups from Perfect Samplers a couple weeks ago.

Make no mistake, I had initially purchased this same brand a while back and had experienced the 'EXPLOSIVE CUP' syndrome many customers are referring to. The weak adhesive they used to seal the lid would simply fail, releasing the contents of the k-cup into a wonderful derpy gross heap of wet cigar ash and empty dreams.
I bypassed this deliciously fun circumstance by simply emptying the k-cup into a refillable filter, finishing the box, and swearing them off until such time as my children were old enough to force into indentured servitude.
My son is now 16 and more than willing to clean a mess or two in order to appease the car gods through the weekend. Figured now was a good time to retry them.
Unfortunately, my master plan failed ceremoniously... No mess... And now I have a teenager stealing my delicious new coffee.
Flavors are great. Not a big fan of the caramel variety as they seem a bit weak. The rest are rather tasty.

Chocolate Lovers Variety Pack,Anita,5.0,Economical way to try new flavors without the committment of buying an entire box of a single flavor,"I received 10 regular coffees (most of them single-source), 10 flavored coffees, 10 decaf coffees (mix of single-source and flavored), 10 cocoas, and 10 teas. It was well worth the gamble as this pack gave me the opportunity to try out flavors which I wouldn't risk buying an entire box for. If a flavor wasn't to my taste, then it was only one pod and I could move on to the next. If it was a flavor which I particularly liked, then I wrote its name down to order an entire box for my collection.

Each pod was well within its 'use by' date and there were no defects. I have absolutely no complaints with the sample pack, and the only admonition I can offer is to remember that you're receiving *assorted* pods. Out of 50 pods, you will invariably find flavors which you'll detest. But, at the same time, you will find flavors which you'll fall in love with. It's a gamble, but whether you're looking for fresh new flavors or just a break from the same old flavors which you have in the pantry, this is worth a try.

In my area, boxes of single flavor pods average around $10 dollars (online or in the store) each. If you try a new flavor by buying a box and hate it, then you're stuck: do you throw away the rest of the box, and thereby throw away the money you spent, or do you frantically try to pawn the rest of the box off on a friend (and still lose your money)? This sampler is fifty *different* flavors and if you don't like one, then you're committed to only the one cup that gets poured into the sink or potted plant.

I wasn't expecting such an awesome variety. Usually I find one or two that I don't like, but I enjoy every flavor this one has to offer. Outstanding!

Item arrived very quickly, as always with Amazon! Can't wait to drink them all so I can order more!

This will definitely be the go-to coffee pack from now on, no doubt about it.

The Coconut Dream is absolutely to die for! By far my favorite in the entire pack, great earthy coconut flavor with a hint of sweetness that my regular sweet cream really helps shine! This one is great as is, with cream, over ice, etc. Hoping to find this one alone so I can add more of it to the collection of k-cups we already have.

Next best flavor is the Italian Chocolate Cheesecake - a mild sweetness with Cheesecake overtones really makes this one shine. Now that I think about it, it might be as good or better than the Coconut Dream... Might have to do some drink testing and find out. The real deal breaker will come down to which one is more universal (iced, blended, etc.)

Crazy Cups Flavored Variety Pack Decaf,Fadi Shamaan,5.0,A 40-Flavor Journey!,"Let me tell you about my experience with the Coffee Pods Variety Pack Sampler, Assorted Single Serve Coffee for Keurig K Cups Coffee Makers, 2 Each of 40 Unique Coffees, Great Coffee Gifts, 80 Count. I ordered this pack on a whim, looking for something to spice up my morning routine. Little did I know, this pack would become my new obsession.

First off, the variety is unparalleled. With 40 unique coffees, there's something for everyone. From bold and strong to sweet and creamy, this pack has it all. And with two pods of each flavor, I could share with my friends and family (though I'll admit, I was tempted to keep them all for myself).

But let's talk about the taste. Oh. My. Goodness. I felt like a kid in a candy store, trying a new flavor every day. The Blueberry Cobbler had me singing ""a-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom"" like Little Richard. The French Vanilla made me want to break out my beret and start speaking with a terrible French accent. And the Caramel Macchiato? Let's just say, I'm pretty sure I saw the face of God.

But the best part? The packaging. The pods come in a beautifully designed box that looks like it belongs on the shelves of a boutique coffee shop. It made me feel fancy just looking at it. And when I opened it up, I was like a kid on Christmas morning, tearing through the packaging to get to the goodies inside.

Overall, I would give this Coffee Pods Variety Pack Sampler a 5 out of 5 stars. It's the perfect gift for any coffee lover, or just a treat for yourself. Plus, it's a great way to discover new flavors without committing to a full bag of coffee. So go ahead, treat yourself. You won't regret it. And who knows, maybe you'll find your new favorite brew (just be prepared to sing its praises like I am).

Here are some dos and don’ts:

Dos:
1. Do choose a variety pack that includes different coffee flavors and roasts so that you can try different types of coffee.
2. Do read the product description carefully to ensure that the coffee pods are compatible with your coffee maker.
3. Do consider the number of coffee pods in the pack and the price per pod to ensure that you are getting good value for money.
4. Do read reviews from other customers to get an idea of the quality of the coffee and the variety pack.
5. Do store the coffee pods in a cool, dry place to ensure that they stay fresh and flavorful.
Don'ts:
1. Don't choose a variety pack without checking the compatibility with your coffee maker, as this may result in wastage.
2. Don't overlook the price per pod, as some variety packs may seem like a good deal, but end up being more expensive per pod than buying individual packs.
3. Don't buy a variety pack without researching the different types of coffee included in the pack, as you may end up with flavors that you don't enjoy.
4. Don't store the coffee pods in a humid environment, as this can cause them to lose their flavor and become stale.
5. Don't assume that a variety pack will include your favorite coffee flavor or roast, as it is important to read the product description carefully to ensure that it meets your preferences."," March 27, 2023",the United States 🇺🇸,"let me tell you about my experience with the coffee pods variety pack sampler, assorted single serve coffee for keurig k cups coffee makers, 2 each of 40 unique coffees, great coffee gifts, 80 count. i ordered this pack on a whim, looking for something to spice up my morning routine. little did i know, this pack would become my new obsession. first off, the variety is unparalleled. with 40 unique coffees, there's something for everyone. from bold and strong to sweet and creamy, this pack has it all. and with two pods of each flavor, i could share with my friends and family (though i'll admit, i was tempted to keep them all for myself). but let's talk about the taste. oh. my. goodness. i felt like a kid in a candy store, trying a new flavor every day. the blueberry cobbler had me singing ""a-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom"" like little richard. the french vanilla made me want to break out my beret and start speaking with a terrible french accent. and the caramel macchiato? let's just say, i'm pretty sure i saw the face of god. but the best part? the packaging. the pods come in a beautifully designed box that looks like it belongs on the shelves of a boutique coffee shop. it made me feel fancy just looking at it. and when i opened it up, i was like a kid on christmas morning, tearing through the packaging to get to the goodies inside. overall, i would give this coffee pods variety pack sampler a 5 out of 5 stars. it's the perfect gift for any coffee lover, or just a treat for yourself. plus, it's a great way to discover new flavors without committing to a full bag of coffee. so go ahead, treat yourself. you won't regret it. and who knows, maybe you'll find your new favorite brew (just be prepared to sing its praises like i am). here are some dos and don’ts: dos: 1. do choose a variety pack that includes different coffee flavors and roasts so that you can try different types of coffee. 2. do read the product description carefully to ensure that the coffee pods are compatible with your coffee maker. 3. do consider the number of coffee pods in the pack and the price per pod to ensure that you are getting good value for money. 4. do read reviews from other customers to get an idea of the quality of the coffee and the variety pack. 5. do store the coffee pods in a cool, dry place to ensure that they stay fresh and flavorful. don'ts: 1. don't choose a variety pack without checking the compatibility with your coffee maker, as this may result in wastage. 2. don't overlook the price per pod, as some variety packs may seem like a good deal, but end up being more expensive per pod than buying individual packs. 3. don't buy a variety pack without researching the different types of coffee included in the pack, as you may end up with flavors that you don't enjoy. 4. don't store the coffee pods in a humid environment, as this can cause them to lose their flavor and become stale. 5. don't assume that a variety pack will include your favorite coffee flavor or roast, as it is important to read the product description carefully to ensure that it meets your preferences.",70.0,59.0,106.0,Very Positive,0.03333333333333333,0.16,0.02666666666666667,0.03333333333333333,0.13333333333333333,0.05333333333333334,0.2733333333333333,0.04,0.09333333333333334,0.15333333333333332

Chocolate Lovers Variety Pack,jennifer trested,4.0,"great tasting coffee, but MUST make sure that the machine pierces the bottom of the cup","This coffee tastes amazing, and brews well.

The one problem, which many other people have mentioned, is that the needle on your machine that needs to pierce the k cup, is not always able to pierce the bottom of these cups. It does cause the coffee to explode all over the place and makes a mess.

There is an easy fix though. My machine has a removable case that the k cup sits in. With other k cups when you put the pod into the case in the machine, the needle will pierce the cup. I don't trust that it will with these cups, so instead I push the cup hard into the case that has the needle, and make sure that it pierces the hole in the bottom before I put it into the machine. Most of the time this works, and you will be able to tell because you can hear the sound when it pierces the cup. If that does not work I cut a hole in the bottom of the cup with a knife. Not a perfect fix but thought I would put it out there that you can make these cups work in the machine.

That said, Crazy Cups really needs to look at their manufacturing process and make the plastic a little thinner.

Also, I tried their method for making the iced coffee and it still tasted watery. I brew my coffee the night before, put it in a travel mug, and let it cool in the refrigerator. I also make some coffee ice cubes out of the same batch of coffee, and put those in the coffee the next day.

Chocolate Lovers Variety Pack,Captain Awesomeness,2.0,4 to 2 stars,"Prior review is below.

I am lowering this to two stars because the second time I ordered this I had an inordinate amount of pods I don't like very much including a duplicate of hot chocolate. The order I had prior were many nice flavored coffees and cappuccinos and top notch tea with some interesting hot chocolate. It did have one of those typical mass produced store brands. This one was very disappointing and I'm cancelling my subscription.

--------------------------
I was very happy with this box I received from subscribe & save, I saw I had it for every 3 months and thought, ""No! Every month at least! This is great!""
Then I saw the price on the next delivery and went with. ""3 months it is!""

Overall it's a very strong blend with one I term as NO (Folgers, we all know what Folgers is. Don't put it into a variety pack).

I loved a lot of the flavored coffees which were much like dessert, but what occurred to me while I was drinking a deluge happened to be...How many calories have I consumed of this wonderful sugary artificial goodness?

I decided some things are best left not knowing.

Chocolate Lovers Variety Pack,Music Wife,2.0,CRAZY CUPS PAY ATTENTION: Be careful if you value your coffee maker but flavor is spot on ; (,"Okay lets start with the pros for encouragement....the flavors of each of these chocolate lovers coffees are spot on (peanut butter and the coconut one are my favorites) all with out any bitter bite and are very smooth.

now the cons: They are not compatible with all Keurig coffee makers, for I have read some people have no problems, but many others have repeated blow outs...I tried one in the pod it came in and it shut down my machine so having read other peoples problem I removed the top and filled my reusable pod with the coffee and it did the samething so I removed some of the coffee and it worked just fine, but still blew out my paper filter I use for easier clean up, Next time I used even less of the coffee in my reusable set up and it worked even better. Now when I removed the top from the first pod I found it had blown out the filter in the pod and that is the reason most people get grounds in their coffee even when it works with their coffee maker. I had to remove all the coffee and put it in individual baggies and use my reusable pods. Part of buying the pods is the convenience of use and these do not provide that, then there is the possible damage it can do to your coffee maker.

So if you do not mind the inconvenience of pouring out the coffee into baggies and then scooping the coffee out into reusable pods it is okay, but it has to be cheaper and a time saver to buy this coffee in bags (if only they came in bags) in place of the pods if you are going to do this. It is a pain to have to open these pods and pour them into individual baggies. Right now I will not be a repeat customer for I just got my new Keurig and want to continue to enjoy it.

Chocolate Lovers Variety Pack,Geoffrey,1.0,These K-Cups spill coffee into my Cuisinart Keurig system!,"My household is coffee drinkers. The Mrs and I drink a pot of coffee every a.m., so we know coffee. The whole point for a K-Cup system is for that one-off cup, or when you don’t feel like drinking a pot! We’re a LavAzza household, ever day… so it’s important to us.

The boys love the hot chocolate… and I was notified that Amazon was out of the Solimo… so they suggested Crazy Cups... Here’s how I arrived in this brand… that we don’t know.. It was a suggestion from Amazon (first mistake).

I purchased the sampler pack, which had five different flavors. Price seemed decent, sure, why not, seems to have an overabundance of positive reviews (I needed to have dug deeper before I pulled this trigger!), so I bought a pack.

Box arrived, excellent packaging... no assembly of rhyme or reason in the box to how the flavors were just thrown in (first lousy omen), and I noticed what felt and seemed like they overstuffed each K-Cup (second horrible omen). So we separated the piles of flavors, and I took one for a test spin.

On the seal, “Freshly Roasted Coffee” – I’ve always found, when they say “good, eat, tasty, etc.” in the title, usually it’s the opposite and chaos ensues, sadly this was not any different. What poured out, smelled terrific, a little too good to be true! At first sip, black coffee, nothing in it, just to taste the base. To my shock and dismay, I was underwhelmed... UNDERWHELEMD PEOPLE!

I’ve had better coffee at Denny’s on a road trip when you need that cuppa, just to keep your eyes peeled on the road.. they have a far better-tasting coffee then this! Secondly, the flavor... “Death by chocolate,” I think not! Frankly, for all the Betty Ford recovering chocaholics, this is insulting to call this chocolate… little foil coins have far better-tasting chocolate then this!

Tried the 2nd K-Cup and BOOM coffee grounds everywhere. Remember the overstuffing comment earlier… well, this is my theory, or it’s just NOT compatible with the system we own... gee that would have been nice to know to go in! Crazy Cups has this weird indentation on the bottom like the K-Cup sat on a basketball.. left an odd dimple… what’s the point?

The other K-Cups that we enjoy, such as Cafe Bustelo, Swiss Miss, LavAzza, and even Amazon’s own Solimo, works fine. Crazy Cups, your K-Cups make the grounds go everywhere except where they belong! Now I am stuck with K-Cups that will probably break then give coffee. This isn’t the first one to do this! I’ll never repurchase your brand!
If you drink coffee, like we drink coffee, this is not your coffee! Crazy Cups K-Cup coffee is a sad joke pretending to be coffee! The base flavor is insulting to any coffee drinker.. and it smells far better then it tastes!"," April 24, 2020",the United States 🇺🇸,"my household is coffee drinkers. the mrs and i drink a pot of coffee every a.m., so we know coffee. the whole point for a k-cup system is for that one-off cup, or when you don’t feel like drinking a pot! we’re a lavazza household, ever day… so it’s important to us. the boys love the hot chocolate… and i was notified that amazon was out of the solimo… so they suggested crazy cups... here’s how i arrived in this brand… that we don’t know.. it was a suggestion from amazon (first mistake). i purchased the sampler pack, which had five different flavors. price seemed decent, sure, why not, seems to have an overabundance of positive reviews (i needed to have dug deeper before i pulled this trigger!), so i bought a pack. box arrived, excellent packaging... no assembly of rhyme or reason in the box to how the flavors were just thrown in (first lousy omen), and i noticed what felt and seemed like they overstuffed each k-cup (second horrible omen). so we separated the piles of flavors, and i took one for a test spin. on the seal, “freshly roasted coffee” – i’ve always found, when they say “good, eat, tasty, etc.” in the title, usually it’s the opposite and chaos ensues, sadly this was not any different. what poured out, smelled terrific, a little too good to be true! at first sip, black coffee, nothing in it, just to taste the base. to my shock and dismay, i was underwhelmed... underwhelemd people! i’ve had better coffee at denny’s on a road trip when you need that cuppa, just to keep your eyes peeled on the road.. they have a far better-tasting coffee then this! secondly, the flavor... “death by chocolate,” i think not! frankly, for all the betty ford recovering chocaholics, this is insulting to call this chocolate… little foil coins have far better-tasting chocolate then this! tried the 2nd k-cup and boom coffee grounds everywhere. remember the overstuffing comment earlier… well, this is my theory, or it’s just not compatible with the system we own... gee that would have been nice to know to go in! crazy cups has this weird indentation on the bottom like the k-cup sat on a basketball.. left an odd dimple… what’s the point? the other k-cups that we enjoy, such as cafe bustelo, swiss miss, lavazza, and even amazon’s own solimo, works fine. crazy cups, your k-cups make the grounds go everywhere except where they belong! now i am stuck with k-cups that will probably break then give coffee. this isn’t the first one to do this! i’ll never repurchase your brand! if you drink coffee, like we drink coffee, this is not your coffee! crazy cups k-cup coffee is a sad joke pretending to be coffee! the base flavor is insulting to any coffee drinker.. and it smells far better then it tastes!",8.0,-1.0,78.0,Very Positive,0.09352517985611511,0.07913669064748201,0.04316546762589928,0.09352517985611511,0.07194244604316546,0.15827338129496402,0.17266187050359713,0.10071942446043165,0.050359712230215826,0.1366906474820144

Crazy Cups Flavored Variety Pack Decaf,Wild Wise Woman,3.0,THESE DON'T FIT Hamilton Beach! (With Update),"NOOOOOOO!!! My 48-cup chocolate sampler arrived this morning and the cups DO NOT FIT in my k-cup brewer!

I have a Hamilton Beach Dual Brewer, and have been using various brands for over a year (I had a Cuisinart k-cup brewer for 5 years before that). I had one variety which the brewer didn't always pierce the top foil, but I learned to check that and puncture with a chopstick. But the Crazy Cups DON'T FIT AT ALL. They won't slide deep enough into the k-cup holder to puncture the bottom, and there is no way I can slide the k-cup holder into the brewer with more than a quarter-inch sticking up on top. I'm adding 2 photos to show how the cups (a Maxwell House decaf) normally fit, and how the Crazy Cups cannot be forced any further down into the Hamilton Beach brewer. SO SAD!

UPDATE: By forcing the cups HARD into the k-cup holder (and having to PRY it out after with a knife!), we were able to get it down enough to close the brewer and make coffee. This stuff tastes GOOD, but the design is not suitable for HB k-cup machines, which cut a notch in the lower corner of the k-cups rather than piercing the bottom as both Keurig and Cuisinart do.

I have been placing the cup into the Keurig and closing the lid to get the punctures in the cup. I then remove the cup, tap out about a teaspoon worth of the grounds, and then replace the cup into the Keurig ensuring the existing puncture holes line up. Then I brew a cup of coffee. Voila!

Crazy Cups Flavored Variety Pack Decaf,Tom G,1.0,Underwhelming flavor and clogged my machine,"I saw this on sale with a bunch of crazy flavors that mostly sounded like ones I'd like. I'm a fan of the Cafe Escapes mocha latte and chai latte which have quite a bit of flavor along with the coffee and expected these to be similar. I've tried many flavors from many brands. These were disappointing.

Flavor:
The first I tried, based on my girlfriend's selection, was the pumpkin vanilla. Strong coffee taste. Was that a hint of pumpkin? I'm not sure, maybe. I tried another flavor, same thing. I selected the Peppermint Chocolate Mocha next figuring that'd be a good one to see if there actually is any flavor since peppermint would likely stand out. Yes, I did detect a slight hint of peppermint. I mean slight.

Compatibility:
I have a Keurig Vue V500 machine which takes Vue cups. I use a k-cup adapter. This has worked fine with every k-cup I've ever used, until now. These cups are a harder plastic than most and the rim around the top is thicker. With the adapter, sometimes cups dent rather than pierce the bottom when inserting. For this reason, I place the cup in the adapter and then slap it home. This has never been a problem. After slapping these into the k-cup adapter, they sat noticeably higher than any other cup I've used. I'm a big 6'4"" guy. Trust that it's not an issue of not hitting it hard enough. Closing the machine on these was cringe-worthy, with more effort required than usual and more noise, but ultimately seemed okay. I used about four of these before my machine spit out half a cup while sounding very strained. I've heard the machine slow down before and running a few cycles with no k-cup generally clears that up by pushing out some grounds. I've now run over a dozen cycles and it's improved slightly but still sounds strained and is only producing 6 ounces instead of 8.

UPDATE: I finally consulted the user guide on cleaning. The little plastic slide-out tray it tells you to pull out and clean did indeed have some build up to be removed. This, however, clearly wasn't the problem as I could see no blockage. I sprayed it out with kitchen faucet sprayer, soaked in hot soapy water and sprayed again. Ran another cycle with no improvement. Next, I peered down inside the machine from the top to view the two needles which mount near the front facing the back. I was able to take a can of compressed air I usually use for blowing dust out of my computer and used it on the needles. I ran another cycle and the pump sounded more normal. It provided 8 ounces again and some grounds were in the cup. I ran a couple more cleaning cycles, spraying the needles with compressed air once more between them and now the machine is running normally."," December 6, 2014",the United States 🇺🇸,"i saw this on sale with a bunch of crazy flavors that mostly sounded like ones i'd like. i'm a fan of the cafe escapes mocha latte and chai latte which have quite a bit of flavor along with the coffee and expected these to be similar. i've tried many flavors from many brands. these were disappointing. flavor: the first i tried, based on my girlfriend's selection, was the pumpkin vanilla. strong coffee taste. was that a hint of pumpkin? i'm not sure, maybe. i tried another flavor, same thing. i selected the peppermint chocolate mocha next figuring that'd be a good one to see if there actually is any flavor since peppermint would likely stand out. yes, i did detect a slight hint of peppermint. i mean slight. compatibility: i have a keurig vue v500 machine which takes vue cups. i use a k-cup adapter. this has worked fine with every k-cup i've ever used, until now. these cups are a harder plastic than most and the rim around the top is thicker. with the adapter, sometimes cups dent rather than pierce the bottom when inserting. for this reason, i place the cup in the adapter and then slap it home. this has never been a problem. after slapping these into the k-cup adapter, they sat noticeably higher than any other cup i've used. i'm a big 6'4"" guy. trust that it's not an issue of not hitting it hard enough. closing the machine on these was cringe-worthy, with more effort required than usual and more noise, but ultimately seemed okay. i used about four of these before my machine spit out half a cup while sounding very strained. i've heard the machine slow down before and running a few cycles with no k-cup generally clears that up by pushing out some grounds. i've now run over a dozen cycles and it's improved slightly but still sounds strained and is only producing 6 ounces instead of 8. update: i finally consulted the user guide on cleaning. the little plastic slide-out tray it tells you to pull out and clean did indeed have some build up to be removed. this, however, clearly wasn't the problem as i could see no blockage. i sprayed it out with kitchen faucet sprayer, soaked in hot soapy water and sprayed again. ran another cycle with no improvement. next, i peered down inside the machine from the top to view the two needles which mount near the front facing the back. i was able to take a can of compressed air i usually use for blowing dust out of my computer and used it on the needles. i ran another cycle and the pump sounded more normal. it provided 8 ounces again and some grounds were in the cup. i ran a couple more cleaning cycles, spraying the needles with compressed air once more between them and now the machine is running normally.",16.0,15.0,63.0,Very Positive,0.0625,0.125,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.125,0.1875,0.0625,0.0,0.375

Crazy Cups Flavored Variety Pack Decaf,Photog Mom,4.0,"Out of the ordinary, mostly delicious flavored coffees","Overall, I really enjoyed these. Most of the flavors are quite unique, which is what made me decide to buy this. I get tired of the same old, same old and enjoy novelty. Not every flavor was to my liking, but I do like most of them.

I’ll go through each flavor and quote what the box says about each, followed by my own opinion on it. I do not claim to be a coffee expert of any kind, just a coffee fan, and a fan of the Keurig system in particular.

I used the larger cup setting on my Keurig (roughly 10 oz of water) for each, since these cups each contain .45 oz of coffee, which is more than the typical .30-.35 oz k-cup. And I like a big cup of coffee. I drank each one black with one Splenda.

The package arrived containing two boxes of 24 capsules each. Each box had six different flavors; four of each.

One major plus, unlike other brands, Crazy Cups are recyclable. Just pull off the lid, dig out and discard the filter and coffee grounds, and then the lid and cup can be rinsed out and recycled.

A possible minus - my Keurig’s brewer needle got partially clogged while I was testing these. (A little bit of coffee spilled inside the machine.) I don't know if it was the fault of the Crazy Cups, but since the last time this happened was another time I used a off-brand cup, it's a good possibility. I gave my machine a thorough cleaning and de-scaling and it’s fine now.

Box 1:

Pumpkin Vanilla Créme: “Treat yourself to the flavor of vanilla-laced pumpkin pie topped with sweet créme."" Pumpkin spice isn’t my favorite type of flavor, and this one does taste like what you’d expect from a pumpkin spice coffee. I can smell the vanilla but can’t taste it. I did taste sour notes which I’m not a fan of. I’ll be saving this one for guests who ARE big pumpkin spice fans.

Bananas Foster Flambé: “Vanilla ice cream and bananas smothered in dark rum, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Treat yourself to The Big Easy’s classic happy ending."" I cannot smell or taste any banana at all. Which is ok, because as much as I love the actual bananas foster dessert, I hate artificial banana flavoring. This is a good coffee, but the only promised flavor I can taste is something sweet, maybe brown sugar. Not vanilla, cinnamon, nor rum. So, why call it Bananas Foster? I like this one but unless my palette is just way off, the name and description are misleading.

Caramel Truffle Sundae: “Dive into the decadence of a sweet caramel, chocolate, and nut ice cream sundae. Just remember to come up for air.” This one is pretty good, though I couldn’t taste anything beyond chocolate and caramel (and coffee of course) here.

Salted Caramel: “Treat yourself to an indulgent cup of rich coffee with the creamy, dreamy taste of salted caramel. Your tastebuds will thank you.” This one was disappointing. Though it smelled lovely, I struggled to taste any caramel. Maybe I’m mixing up salt and sour, but personally I found the predominant note to be sour.

Frosted Oatmeal Cookie: “Experience the taste of fresh-baked, vanilla-frosted oatmeal cookies, and take a flavor trip down memory lane.” This one tastes and smells about as much as its name and description as possible. The predominant flavor was cinnamon, though there is definitely a sense of warm vanilla as well. Whatever, this one is just delicious.

Cinnamon Churro: “It’s coffee with the taste of just-fried dough, rolled in cinnamon and sugar. Ay Caramba!"" This one is delicious. I can definitely smell cinnamon and butter. The taste is mostly cinnamon but I do detect buttery notes as well. Yum.

Box 2:

Peppermint Chocolate Mocha: “Peppermint, chocolate, and mocha. It’s more than coffee - it’s a party in a mug.” Wonderful. The peppermint is definitely there, but it doesn’t overpower the chocolate flavor.

Chocolate Coconut Dream: “Let the taste of luscious chocolate and creamy coconut coffee transport you to your own private island. Take a sip - you’re livin' the dream.” I loved this one. It’s very similar to Coffee People’s version of this flavor. It does indeed taste how you’d expect. The chocolate is stronger than the coconut.

Italian Chocolate Cheesecake: “Luscious cheesecake meets decadent chocolate at a small caffé in Firenze. Take a sip. Join them.” This smelled amazing (and sure, that might have been a cheesecake scent) and also tasted great. But the taste was just chocolate, to me. I tried really hard to sense any other notes, but…just chocolate coffee. Which is by no means a bad thing. But it did not transport me to Florence.

Chocolate Raspberry Truffle: “A luscious combination of tangy raspberries and rich dark chocolate. Go ahead and brew yourself a cup. You’ve earned it.” Yummy. The chocolate and raspberry flavors are both present and balanced. This is a lot like the Van Houtte version.

Death By Chocolate: “It’s the coffee with a chocolate taste to die for. One sip, and you’re in chocolate nirvana.” Yup, pretty much. Chocolate coffee fans, this is it.

Chocolate Chipotle Mole: “Dark Chocolate and the Chipotle Pepper twins have a torrid affair in a coffee-filled hot tub. Es caliente y es bueno!” This one was tasty but not like the (frankly bizarre) description. I’d call it a solid chocolate flavor, very similar to other brands’ chocolate flavors. I did not sense any chipotle, but I still enjoyed it a lot."," March 2, 2015",the United States 🇺🇸,"overall, i really enjoyed these. most of the flavors are quite unique, which is what made me decide to buy this. i get tired of the same old, same old and enjoy novelty. not every flavor was to my liking, but i do like most of them. i’ll go through each flavor and quote what the box says about each, followed by my own opinion on it. i do not claim to be a coffee expert of any kind, just a coffee fan, and a fan of the keurig system in particular. i used the larger cup setting on my keurig (roughly 10 oz of water) for each, since these cups each contain .45 oz of coffee, which is more than the typical .30-.35 oz k-cup. and i like a big cup of coffee. i drank each one black with one splenda. the package arrived containing two boxes of 24 capsules each. each box had six different flavors; four of each. one major plus, unlike other brands, crazy cups are recyclable. just pull off the lid, dig out and discard the filter and coffee grounds, and then the lid and cup can be rinsed out and recycled. a possible minus - my keurig’s brewer needle got partially clogged while i was testing these.

Crazy Cups Flavored Variety Pack Decaf,Sarah Anne,4.0,Issues with Keurig,"The flavors of these k-cups are really strong and really delicious. However, my Keurig Classic shuts off when I load them. I'm not sure if it's the material of the cups or the slight rounding, but the lower needle doesn't pierce through the bottom of the cup and the machine shuts off as a safety precaution. I have to push on the cup while stabilizing the bottom of the Keurig cup holder to manually pierce the bottom of the Crazy Cup before closing the cup holder and selecting my brew size.

It took me a couple of days to figure out the issue since opening and shutting and removing the cup and replacing it, and turning the machine on and off, switching outlets, etc., would eventually result in the bottom of the cup being pierced and a successful brew. I thought something was wrong with my Keurig -- it was really frustrating.

Crazy Cups Flavored Variety Pack Decaf,Pokin,4.0,"Smells, good, a bit weak in flavour (but no more so than regular cups), larger cup size","First of all, this coffee pack DOES come with 12 flavours. Reviewers that claim the package only comes with 6 may not have realized that one side of the box lists 3 flavours and the other side of the box lists 3 different flavours. 2 boxes x 3 flavours per side x 2 sides = 12 flavours. When you open the box, the flavours are stacked so that you have to dig to the bottom to get the all the different flavours.

The twelve flavours for this kit are:

Peppermint Chocolate Mocha
Chocolate Raspberry Truffle
Italian Chocolate Cheese
Chocolate Coconut Dream
Chocolate Chipotle Mole
Death by Chocolate
Pumpkin Vanilla Creme
Froasted Oatmeal Cookie
Caramel Truffle Sundae
Bananas Foster Flambe
Cinnamon Churro
Salted Caramel

All of the coffee that we did brew out of this kit smelled really nice. I think that's the best part of the kit. I found the coffee that got brewed to be a little on the weak side, but I have that same issue with all coffee brewed with a Keurig cup so it's no worse than normal. The cup size does run slightly larger than the standard Keurig cups, which isn't a problem for the Keurig coffee maker, but may mean it doesn't fit into a k-cup tray. I ordered the  DecoBros Crystal Glass Coffee Storage Drawer Holder for Keurig K-Cup Pods  and they are slightly too large for the tray and I find I have to stack them sideways instead of upright.

Chocolate Chipotle Mole - Smooth subtle chocolate taste with a hint of chipotle for flavor, not spice or heat - 5/5

Chocolate Raspberry Truffle - You can definitely smell the raspberry, but the taste of it is very subtle. The chocolate taste is also quite mild, still not too bad overall - 3/5

Italian Chocolate Cheesecake - Subtle smooth creamy chocolate flavor, nothing fancy, and nothing that in my opinion taste like cheesecake, still good though - 4/5

Chocolate Coconut Dream - Smooth chocolate and coconut flavors that compliment each other, both distinguishable, neither overpowering - 5/5

Death by Chocolate - Really nice chocolate flavor, if you like a good mocha. I didn't find the chocolate to be overpowering as the name might suggest - 5/5

Peppermint Chocolate Mocha - Mellow mint flavor complimented by a smooth chocolate flavor, so actually tastes like the name! - 5/5

Salted Caramel - Mild caramel taste, salted caramel aftertaste - 3/5

Bananas Foster Flambé - Nice banana flavor, I've never had bananas foster flambé, but if that's what it tastes like then I should probably give it a try - 4/5

Cinnamon Churro - Distictive cinnamon flavor really came through quite nicely - 5/5

Pumpkin Vanilla Crème - Distinctive spice flavor, perhaps 'pumpkin spice', I did not sense any hint of vanilla - 2/5

Caramel Truffle Sundae - I honestly can't say I could distinguish any caramel, truffle, or sundae flavors. That being said it has a different yet good taste - 3/5

Frosted Oatmeal Cookie - Subtle cinnamon/vanilla flavor with a noticable cinnamon aftertaste - 4/5

My new coffee maker does not have the issues with the K-cups not draining properly and having coffee grounds left in cup. This is now my preferred brand of decaf flavored coffee.

It's almost impossible to find flavored decaf coffee K-cups in the store other than French Vanilla and Hazelnut.

Although Chocolate Italian Cheesecake is a bit of a stretch. :) My only issue has been with the K-cups themselves. 6 of the 8 I have had so far start off strong when brewing but then at about 15 seconds in, the water starts to slowly drip taking about 3 minutes for it to finish brewing. In the end I get only 2/3 of a typical cup size. When I take K-cup out of the machine, it is very heavy with water indicating that it is not draining completely.

Crazy Cups Flavored Variety Pack Decaf,S. Sisk,5.0,Great customer service,"Awesome customer service. I received a sampler box with a label ahowing decaf coffee sampler. But when I opened the box all of the pods were regular Medium Roast.
I contacted the seller and they sent a box of decaf flavored pods within the week.
I was able to give the regular pods away to someone who will enjoy them. Hopefully they will order a similar sampler when they run out. I plan to!

Chocolate Lovers Variety Pack,yukicharley,5.0,Great flavors,"I love sampler packs. I love that I can try all different kinds of flavors at once. I have tried Crazy Cups before and they won me over with most of their flavors. This one was no different. I don't love ALL the flavors, but I love most of them. Disclosure - I rarely drink these by themselves and usually add them to my decaf coffee - meaning I brew a hot cocoa pod on the 8oz setting and then a 4oz decaf pod on top. So my experiences of the flavors might be a little skewed. But really, they all have good flavor and this has become my favorite hot cocoa pod company, now.
